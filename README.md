### Hi there!

- I'm currently doing a master's degree in data science and now at the stage of writing my thesis.
- Currently based in Lisbon and originally from Germany.
- Although I'm relatively new to the data science environment, I'm a quick and eager learner.
- My studies have taken me through exciting fields like reinforcement learning, text mining, and deep learning.
- If you're curious, check out my repositories for some  projects I've been working on in the past few months!
